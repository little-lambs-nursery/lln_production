                                    <p>Separation anxiety is seen in very young children from 18 months to 3 years. The signs of separation anxiety can be seen in an infant even as early as 4-5months. However, this is when it is considered as the baby being securely attached to the parent and it means that the baby has formed a strong bond with the parent. It is a normal part of growing up. Young children cry and are clingy when the caregivers/parents leave. Babies and toddlers grow out of this distress as they grow. However, there are ways to reduce the distress and CAMP is a graduated approach to dealing with the signs/symptoms of separation anxiety</p>

PEP will focus on supporting healthy eating habits by increasing the number of foods in the child’s repertoire. The final goal of the program is food acceptance; hence the entire program’s approach is based on positive reinforcement by all the key instructors of the program.

This is the best program for our little ones who need a little more comfort, guidance, love and support or who are planning to take the next step of being in a formal school</p>
