                                    <p>Separation anxiety is seen in very young children from 18 months to 3 years. The signs of separation anxiety can be seen in an infant even as early as 4-5months. However, this is when it is considered as the baby being securely attached to the parent and it means that the baby has formed a strong bond with the parent. It is a normal part of growing up. Young children cry and are clingy when the caregivers/parents leave. Babies and toddlers grow out of this distress as they grow. However, there are ways to reduce the distress and CAMP is a graduated approach to deal with the signs/symptoms of separation anxiety</p>
